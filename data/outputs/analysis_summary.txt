RESEARCH QUESTION ANALYSIS REPORT
======================================================================

Research Question:
To what extent does current permeable pavement distribution align with 
stormwater flood vulnerability in the urban rail corridors between 
Seattle and Tacoma?

======================================================================
ANSWER: POOR ALIGNMENT - SIGNIFICANT GAPS IDENTIFIED
======================================================================

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS:
The analysis reveals a POOR alignment between green stormwater 
infrastructure (GSI) deployment and flood vulnerability in the 
Seattle-Tacoma rail corridor. Only 5.8% of the corridor demonstrates 
optimal alignment (high vulnerability + high infrastructure), while 
44.2% represents critical gaps (high vulnerability + low infrastructure).

INTERPRETATION
======================================================================

EXTENT OF ALIGNMENT: LIMITED (5.8%)

Only 135 segments (5.8% of the corridor) show optimal alignment where 
high vulnerability coincides with high infrastructure deployment. This 
represents just 6,536 acres of the 112,277-acre corridor.

CRITICAL FINDINGS:

1. MASSIVE GAP: 44.2% of corridor (49,627 acres) has HIGH vulnerability 
   but LOW infrastructure. These 1,025 segments represent areas where 
   stormwater flooding risk is elevated but GSI deployment is minimal.

2. HIGH CORRIDOR VULNERABILITY: 90.5% of the rail corridor exhibits 
   high flood vulnerability (mean score 8.42/10), driven by:
   - High imperviousness (84.2% mean)
   - Urban development patterns
   - Limited natural drainage

3. INSUFFICIENT COVERAGE: Only 20.7% of the corridor area has any GSI 
   infrastructure, leaving 79.3% unprotected.

4. NO STATISTICAL CORRELATION: Pearson correlation r=0.000 (p=0.998) 
   indicates infrastructure deployment is NOT systematically targeted 
   to high-vulnerability areas.

SPATIAL PATTERNS:

• Infrastructure is concentrated in Seattle proper (54,720 facilities)
• Tacoma corridor largely unserved
• Deployment appears driven by:
  - Jurisdictional boundaries (Seattle vs. other)
  - Development timing
  - NOT by flood vulnerability targeting

======================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
======================================================================

PRIORITY 1: Address Q2 Gap Segments (High Priority)
  • Target: 1,025 segments (49,627 acres)
  • Focus: High vulnerability + Low infrastructure
  • Strategy: Prioritize GSI deployment in these areas

PRIORITY 2: Expand Coverage Beyond Seattle
  • Current: Seattle-centric deployment
  • Needed: Regional coordination (Tacoma, Kent, Auburn, etc.)
  • Approach: Inter-jurisdictional planning

PRIORITY 3: Vulnerability-Based Targeting
  • Implement data-driven site selection
  • Use vulnerability index to prioritize projects
  • Move beyond opportunistic deployment

PRIORITY 4: Scale Up Investment
  • Current coverage: 20.7% of corridor
  • Target: Minimum 50% coverage in high-vulnerability areas
  • Estimated need: ~30,000 additional acres of GSI

======================================================================
CONCLUSION
======================================================================

The current permeable pavement distribution shows POOR ALIGNMENT with 
flood vulnerability in the Seattle-Tacoma rail corridor. 

With only 5.8% of the corridor demonstrating optimal infrastructure 
placement and 44.2% representing critical gaps, there is substantial 
opportunity to improve flood resilience through strategic GSI deployment 
targeted to high-vulnerability areas.

The findings suggest infrastructure deployment has been driven more by 
jurisdictional and opportunistic factors than by systematic flood risk 
assessment. A vulnerability-based targeting approach could significantly 
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of future investments.
