### 🟡 **KING COUNTY** (Regional Authority)

**King County Stormwater Services**

**Portal Searched:**
- https://gis-kingcounty.opendata.arcgis.com/

**Findings:**
- No dedicated GSI or permeable pavement datasets found on open data portal
- County manages extensive stormwater infrastructure (66,000+ accounts mentioned in Tacoma context)
- May maintain internal GIS databases not publicly available

**Potential Data Sources:**
- King County Water and Land Resources Division
- May require public records request for GSI facility data

**Recommendation:** 
- Contact King County Department of Natural Resources and Parks (DNRP)
- Request information on GSI facilities in unincorporated areas and regional facilities
- Check for internal stormwater asset management databases

---

### 🔴 **OTHER CITIES** (Limited/No Data Found)

#### **Renton, Kent, Auburn, Tukwila**

**Status:** Open data portals exist but no specific GSI datasets identified

**Potential Reasons:**
1. GSI data may be maintained in internal asset management systems
2. Data may be included in broader "stormwater facilities" datasets without specific GSI designation
3. Cities may not track GSI separately from conventional stormwater infrastructure
4. Data may exist but requires direct request from Public Works departments

**Recommended Action:**
Contact each city's Public Works or Stormwater Management department directly:

- **Renton Public Works:** Check stormwater utility records
- **Kent Public Works:** 253-856-5200
- **Auburn Public Works:** Request GSI facility inventory
- **Tukwila Public Works:** Inquire about LID/GSI tracking

#### **Sumner, Puyallup, Fife**

**Status:** Limited or no open data portals found

**Recommendation:** Direct contact with city departments required
- Request GSI facility inventories
- Inquire about any stormwater management plans that document green infrastructure
- Check comprehensive stormwater management plans (SWMP) for facility lists

---

## Alternative Data Sources

### 1. **Department of Ecology (DOE) - Washington State**

**Potential Resources:**
- Stormwater permits and facility plans
- Municipal Stormwater Permits (Phase I and Phase II)
- URL: https://ecology.wa.gov/

**What to Request:**
- NPDES permit documentation (may include GSI facility inventories)
- Stormwater Management Program (SWMP) annual reports
- These often include facility inventories and locations

### 2. **Puget Sound Partnership**

- Regional stormwater and LID implementation tracking
- May have aggregated GSI data from member jurisdictions

### 3. **Low Impact Development (LID) Studies & Reports**

**Sources:**
- University of Washington research projects
- Puget Sound Institute studies
- Washington State University Extension publications

### 4. **Public Records Requests**

**Process:**
- Each city has public records request procedures
- Request: "GIS data or inventory of green stormwater infrastructure facilities including rain gardens, bioretention facilities, permeable pavement, and other LID features"
- Typical response time: 5-30 days

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Contact Tacoma Stormwater Utility**
   - Request comprehensive GSI facility inventory
   - Ask about data formats and attribute fields available
   - Inquiry about update frequency

2. **Submit Public Records Requests**
   - Prepare standard request letter for all cities
   - Request GSI facility inventories in GIS format
   - Include specific data fields needed (location, facility type, installation date, size, etc.)

3. **Contact King County DNRP**
   - Inquire about regional GSI tracking
   - Request data for unincorporated areas
   - Ask about data sharing agreements with cities

### Long-Term Data Development:

If publicly available data remains limited, consider:

1. **Field Inventory**
   - Systematic survey of study area
   - Use of remote sensing to identify potential GSI features
   - Ground-truthing with site visits

2. **Permit Database Mining**
   - Review building and development permits for LID requirements
   - Extract GSI facility information from permit conditions
   - Create custom database from permit records

3. **Imagery Analysis**
   - High-resolution aerial imagery analysis
   - Identify permeable pavement by surface characteristics
   - Map potential rain garden locations by landscape features

4. **Partnership Development**
   - Collaborate with cities to improve data accessibility
   - Offer to help standardize GSI data collection
   - Share final analysis results to support municipal planning

## Data Quality Considerations

When obtaining GSI data, request the following attributes:

### Essential Fields:
- **Location:** Latitude/Longitude or address
- **Facility Type:** Rain garden, bioretention, permeable pavement, bioswale, etc.
- **Installation Date:** Year installed
- **Size/Capacity:** Square footage, volume, drainage area served
- **Status:** Active, inactive, maintenance needed
- **Owner:** Public, private, partnership

### Desirable Fields:
- **Design specifications:** Soil type, vegetation, infiltration rate
- **Maintenance history:** Frequency, type of maintenance
- **Performance data:** Monitoring results if available
- **Cost information:** Installation and maintenance costs
- **Photos/Documentation:** Visual records

## Conclusion

**Current State:**
- **Limited public GSI datasets** available for direct download
- **Tacoma** has the most comprehensive public documentation of GSI programs
- Most other cities likely maintain GSI data internally but not on public portals

**Data Acquisition Strategy:**
1. Start with Tacoma as proof-of-concept
2. Submit targeted public records requests to all other cities
3. Contact county agencies for regional data
4. Plan for potential field verification and supplementary data collection

**Expected Timeline:**
- Tacoma data request: 1-2 weeks
- Public records requests: 2-4 weeks per city
- Complete data compilation: 2-3 months

**Alternative Approach:**
If comprehensive GSI datasets cannot be obtained, consider expanding to broader "stormwater facilities" datasets and filtering for green infrastructure characteristics based on facility type designations.
